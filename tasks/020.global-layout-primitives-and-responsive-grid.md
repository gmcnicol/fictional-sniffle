# 020 — Global Layout Primitives & Responsive Grid

**Goal:** Replace ad-hoc divs with composable primitives and a grid that guarantees centering for the reader.

## Deliverables

- `src/components/layout/Container.tsx`, `Stack.tsx`, `Grid.tsx` with props for gap, align, justify, maxWidth.
- Reader viewport wrapper that centers content both horizontally and vertically using CSS Grid/Flex with fallback.
- Max text width 72ch; comic area can exceed but must center.

## Tests

- E2E: Reader route centers a 1200×800 test image exactly (check bounding box within ±2px of container center).
- Unit: layout utility props compute expected classnames/styles.

## CI Gates

- Playwright test verifies centering math via DOM rects.
- No CLS introduced (Lighthouse CLS ≤ 0.1).

## Acceptance Criteria

- On desktop and mobile, comic image is visually centered both axes.
- No horizontal scrollbars unless user zooms.
- All CI checks pass.
