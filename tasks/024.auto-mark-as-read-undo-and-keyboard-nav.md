# 024 — Auto Mark‑as‑Read, Undo & Keyboard Navigation

**Goal:** Robust read state behavior with undo, plus accessible keyboard shortcuts.

## Deliverables

- IntersectionObserver: mark read when ≥60% of article visible for ≥1.5s.
- Undo toast with 5s window; `u` toggles read/unread.
- Navigation shortcuts: `j` next, `k` prev, `o` open original, `/` focus search, `g` feeds.
- Persistent read state in Dexie; scroll position restore.

## Tests

- Unit: read-state reducer logic; debounce/timers.
- Playwright:
  - Simulate visibility threshold and assert read toggle.
  - Undo restores unread state.
  - Keyboard shortcuts operate and announce via aria-live.
- a11y: aria-live region announces changes.

## CI Gates

- 0 flake on Playwright runs (retry=2 allowed, final green required).
- Coverage thresholds met.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Auto read works without false positives during quick scroll.
- Undo always available and reliable.
- All CI checks pass.
