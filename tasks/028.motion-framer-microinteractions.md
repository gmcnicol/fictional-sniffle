# 028 — Motion: Framer Micro‑interactions (Respect Reduced Motion)

**Goal:** Add tasteful motion that never impedes reading.

## Deliverables

- Feed list enter/exit; refresh pulse; reader transition.
- Motion durations 100–150ms; easing `easeOut` or similar; no bounce.
- Disable or minimize on reduced-motion.

## Tests

- Visual regression screenshots (Playwright) with and without reduced-motion to confirm absence/presence.
- Unit: motion toggles respect user setting.

## CI Gates

- No animation causes layout shift or performance regression (Lighthouse metrics intact).

## Acceptance Criteria

- Motion present but subtle; removed when reduced-motion is on.
- All CI checks pass.
