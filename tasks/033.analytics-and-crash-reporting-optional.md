# 033 — Analytics & Crash Reporting (Optional, Privacy‑Safe)

**Goal:** Basic visibility into failures without PII.

## Deliverables

- Error boundary component capturing exceptions; console + optional endpoint log.
- Minimal event: pageview/reader-open count, no PII or URLs beyond domain.
- Opt-in setting in `settings` (default off).

## Tests

- Unit: error boundary renders fallback and logs once.
- E2E: induce a controlled error route; boundary catches and shows friendly message.

## CI Gates

- No network noise when analytics disabled.
- All other gates unaffected.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Controlled, opt-in analytics; safe crash capture.
- All CI checks pass.
