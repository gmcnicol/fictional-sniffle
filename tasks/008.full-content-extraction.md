# 008 — Full Content Extraction (Readability + Heuristics)

**Goal:** Attempt to show the complete article or the best main image.

## Deliverables
- Readability pipeline: fetch HTML (subject to CORS), run Readability in a worker (with `linkedom`) to avoid blocking UI, sanitize with DOMPurify.
- Heuristic image selection: prefer single large image within main content; fallback to `<meta property="og:image">` if available.
- Domain rules JSON for popular comics (xkcd, SMBC, etc.).

## Acceptance Criteria
- For at least two well-known comics, full image is extracted even when RSS lacks an enclosure.
- If CORS blocks, app falls back gracefully and explains “Open Original”.
