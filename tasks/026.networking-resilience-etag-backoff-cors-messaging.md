# 026 — Networking Resilience: ETag/Backoff & CORS Messaging

**Goal:** Resilient fetch loops with polite backoff and explicit user feedback.

## Deliverables

- ETag/Last-Modified caching when provided; conditional requests.
- Exponential backoff with jitter on failures; per-feed retry status surfaced in UI.
- Clear per-feed error banner with actionable text for CORS blocks (and optional proxy URL setting).

## Tests

- Unit: backoff schedule; ETag header handling; error mapping to UI states.
- E2E: Simulated 429/5xx retries limited as configured; error surfaces; recover on success.

## CI Gates

- No unhandled promise rejections.
- Network retry logic covered ≥90%.

## Acceptance Criteria

- No infinite loops; backoff behaves; user understands CORS next steps.
- All CI checks pass.
