# 029 — Performance Budgets: Lighthouse + Code Splitting

**Goal:** Enforce strict perf budgets with automated checks.

## Deliverables

- Dynamic import split: reader vs management.
- Image lazy-loading + `decoding="async"`, aspect-ratio placeholders.
- Lighthouse CI config (`.lighthouserc.js`) for mobile with thresholds:
  - Performance ≥ 90, LCP ≤ 2.5s, TTI ≤ 3.0s, CLS ≤ 0.1.
- Bundle analyzer in CI; fail if initial JS > 150KB gzip.

## Tests

- LHCI runs in Actions on built site (serve-static).
- Unit: placeholder aspect-ratio calculation utils.

## CI Gates

- LHCI step blocks merge if thresholds not met.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Budgets enforced; Reader route meets thresholds on CI runner.
- All CI checks pass.
