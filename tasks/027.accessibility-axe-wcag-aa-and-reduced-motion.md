# 027 â€” Accessibility: axe + WCAG AA + Reduced Motion

**Goal:** Baseline conformance across routes with reduced motion support.

## Deliverables

- Roles/landmarks, skip-to-content, visible focus rings.
- `prefers-reduced-motion`: remove/simplify animations accordingly.
- jest-axe or playwright-axe suite across key screens (reader, feeds, settings).

## Tests

- a11y: no axe violations of WCAG AA for text contrast and semantics.
- E2E: reduced-motion media query toggles animation behavior.

## CI Gates

- a11y tests block merges if any violation present.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Keyboard-only navigation is complete and efficient.
- All CI checks pass.
