# 021 — Reader Experience: Comic Centering & Captioning

**Goal:** Reader route shows title/source/date/actions and a perfectly centered comic with alt text caption.

## Deliverables

- `src/features/reader/Reader.tsx`:
  - Title, source domain, published date, actions: Open Original, Mark Unread.
  - Comic image: fit-to-width up to container, maintain aspect ratio, no pixelation.
  - Alt text caption under image when `alt` or `title` present; muted styling, readable line-length.
  - Optional zoom/pan (wheel+drag or controls) without breaking centering at default zoom.
- Scroll restoration per feed and per article.

## Tests

- Playwright:
  - Loads an article fixture with alt text; verifies caption text content and visibility.
  - Resizes viewport to mobile & desktop; image remains centered and fully visible without overlap.
  - Keyboard `o` opens original link target in a new tab (assert link href).
- Unit: date formatting, domain extraction, caption rendering logic.

## CI Gates

- Axe: caption is announced to SR (figure/figcaption or aria-describedby).
- Lighthouse Perf ≥ 90 on Reader route sample.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Caption renders beneath the image for alt/title sources.
- Centering is pixel-accurate within ±2px; no layout shift on load.
- All CI checks pass.
