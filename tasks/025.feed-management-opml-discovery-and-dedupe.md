# 025 — Feed Management, OPML, Discovery & Dedupe

**Goal:** Industrial-grade feed lifecycle with import/export and discovery.

## Deliverables

- Add/edit/remove feeds with validation and dedupe by normalized URL.
- Optional folders/tags with unread counts and sort options.
- OPML import/export preserving folder structure; reject invalid with actionable errors.
- Discovery: when homepage URL entered, fetch and detect `<link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml">` etc. (subject to CORS).

## Tests

- Unit: URL normalization/dedupe; OPML parse/export round-trip.
- E2E: Import sample OPML (≥10 feeds), folders preserved; discovery finds at least 1 feed; unread counts correct after sync.

## CI Gates

- All tests pass; no console errors in E2E.
- Type-safe repos for Dexie operations.

## Acceptance Criteria

- User can manage feeds without duplicates; OPML round-trip lossless.
- All CI checks pass.
