# 007 â€” Reader View & Comic Centering

**Goal:** Create the reading view that centers comics and shows alt text.

## Deliverables
- Reader page with article title, source, date, actions (open original, mark unread).
- Display **main image** centered both horizontally and vertically within the viewport; fit-to-width with max-size constraints and pan-on-zoom (optional).
- If image includes `alt` or `title`, render it as a caption beneath the image (styled subtly).
- If full content is available, render cleaned HTML below the image.

## Acceptance Criteria
- For image-based posts, image is centered and looks good on desktop and mobile.
- Alt text renders under the image when present (e.g., xkcd).
