# 016 â€” Domain Rules & XKCD Polishing

**Goal:** Bulletproof the common comic sources.

## Deliverables

- Domain rule JSON for: xkcd.com, smbc-comics.com, dilbert.com (archival), penny-arcade.com, etc. (as feasible).
- For xkcd: prefer `#comic img` `src` and capture its `title` attribute as the **Alt text** caption.
- Unit tests with saved fixtures (HTML samples).

## Acceptance Criteria

- xkcd shows correct image + alt text under image reliably.
- At least two more domains handled via rules.

## Checklist

- [ ] Rules JSON
- [ ] XKCD extractor
- [ ] Fixtures + tests
