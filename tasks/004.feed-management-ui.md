# 004 â€” Feed Management UI

**Goal:** Add/edit/remove feeds; optional folders; OPML import/export; discovery.

## Deliverables
- Feed list with unread counts and last updated.
- Add Feed dialog: paste URL (feed or site). Attempt feed discovery via `<link rel="alternate">` after fetching HTML (CORS permitting).
- Edit Feed (title, folder).
- Delete feed (confirm dialog).
- OPML import/export. Dedup by normalized URL.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Can add a known RSS URL (e.g., xkcd) and see items after sync.
- OPML import adds multiple feeds, keeps folder structure.
- Export creates a valid OPML file and downloads it.
