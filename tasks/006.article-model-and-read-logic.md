# 006 — Article Model & Read Logic

**Goal:** Normalize article content and implement automatic mark-as-read.

## Deliverables

- Article normalization: choose `mainImageUrl` from (1) enclosure img, (2) first `<img>` in `content:encoded` or `summary`, (3) later via Reader extraction.
- Auto mark-as-read when ≥60% of article card/reader viewport is visible for 1.5s. Undo action within a toast/snackbar.
- Manual toggle read/unread.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Scrolling through list marks items read per rule; toggling works.
- Read state persists across reloads.

- [ ] Normalizer
